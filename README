Raspberry Pi 3.3V output at a specific rate using hardware pwm. 

Requires pigpio library (and sudo).

This uses GPIO port 12, which has hardware PWM support on this specific pi (Model 3B v1.2) . Note that here, it corresponds to physical port 32! 
You may need to change this port if you have a different model!

sudo ./trigger_pulser [freq=1000]
